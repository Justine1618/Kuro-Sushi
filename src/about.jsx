            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Kuro Sushi was founded in 1989 by one of LA's best sushi chefs. Since then
            we have been a leader in the local sushi scene. We were one of the first 
            revolving sushi bars on the west coast, and remain a premier location.</p>
            <h2>Charity Work</h2>
            <p>Kuro Sushi is very involved in the local community, and we pride ourselves
            in our charitable work. Through the Kuro Sushi Foundation we provide assistance
            to local youths as well as promoting the art of sushi making. If you would like
            to make a donation to the Kuro Sushi Foundation, please inquire with a manager
            during your visit.</p>
